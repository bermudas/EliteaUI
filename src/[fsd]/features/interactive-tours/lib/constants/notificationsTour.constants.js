- **Search** — filter notifications by keyword
- **Sort** — order by date
- **Mark as read** — mark individual notifications or all at once
- **Bulk delete** — select multiple notifications and delete them in one action

Notifications are generated automatically by platform events. Current notification types include:

- **Agent unpublished** — a published agent version was removed from Agents HUB
- **User added to conversation** — you were added to a shared conversation
- **Project created** — a new project was successfully created
- **Index data changed (success)** — a toolkit index was created or reindexed successfully
- **Index data changed (failed)** — an indexing operation failed
- **Bucket expiration warning** — a bucket will begin deleting files within 24 hours
- **Personal access token expiring** — a personal token will expire within 24 hours`,

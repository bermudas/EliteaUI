    content: `Agents HUB is a shared library of community-published agents. Unlike the Agents menu — where you create and manage your own agents — HUB gives you read-only access to agents published by other users across all projects.

Each agent in HUB is a fully configured AI assistant built for a specific purpose. You can browse, preview, and start conversations with any published agent without building one from scratch.`,

    content: `Use search and category filters together to narrow the agent library to what you need:

- **Search** — find agents by name or description; results update as you type
- **Category filters** — filter by Trending, My Liked, or domain categories such as Development, Documentation, Business Analysis, Test Management, Learning, Elitea, and Other
- Multiple category filters can be active simultaneously`,

Published agents can also be added directly from Chat without visiting Agents HUB. Use the \`#\` mention or the **+** button in the Participants panel to search for and add any published agent to an ongoing conversation.`,

    content: `When using a published agent in Chat, you can adjust certain settings for your session without affecting the original agent or how it appears to other users.

Modifiable settings:

- LLM model selection
- Model parameters (temperature, top-P, top-K, max tokens)
- Variable values

Read-only (cannot be changed):

- Agent instructions
- Welcome message
- Conversation starters
- Toolkits attached to the agent

All modifications apply only to your current conversation and do not affect the published agent for other users.`,
